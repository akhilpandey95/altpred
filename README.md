# altpred
An independent study trying to understand the relationship between scholarly articles and scholarly reference indicators.

# Abstract

# Features
TBA

# Methodology

# Research Questions
- Can we build features from scholarly texts to identify how does altmetrics for a scientific
text change over time ?
- Can we build features from scholarly texts to identify how does social media impact for a
scientific text change over time ?
- Can we identify what features are important for contributing the change in altmetrics and
social media indicators over time ?

# Predicting altmetrics
The first part of the research would involve building machine learning models that use
features from the scholarly texts for the regression and neural network models in predicting
altmetrics at different time periods.  The focus would be on the following:
	- Building regression models that use features from scholarly papers to predict the altmetrics for a given scholarly paper at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.
    - Evaluating the models by measuring mean squared error, r-squared value in order to
identify which model performs the best when predicting the response.
	- Using p-values to identify which coefficients are statistically significant in predicting
altmetrics.

# Predicting social media Impact
The second part of the research would also involve building machine learning models that
use features from the scholarly texts for regression and neural network models in predicting social media metrics at different periods of time. The focus would be on the following:
	- Building regression models that use features from scholarly papers to predict the social
media count for a given scholarly paper at different time intervals.
	- Evaluating the models by measuring mean squared error, r-squared value in order to
identify which model performs the best when predicting the response.
	- Using p-values to identify which coefficients are statistically significant in predicting
different social media counts.
